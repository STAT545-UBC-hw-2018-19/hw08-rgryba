## Bearded seal dive depth app

This repo contains an app I created to look at bearded seal dive data, specifically the maximum dive depth. 

This app allows the user to select the time period of the dive data presented using a slider, select which (or both seals) they would like to see the data for, and tells the user the maximum dive depth during that time period. 

## File locations
The app is located at https://rgryba.shinyapps.io/ebdives/

The code can be found [here](ebDives) 

Note: This is using fake data as the real data hasn't been published yet and I have client requirements around this.
